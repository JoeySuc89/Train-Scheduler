# Train-Scheduler

Welcome to my Train Scheduler app. Using a Firebase Database and moment.js with some jquery
dynamically created elements I bring you the train schedule app.

Just type in a Name, Destination, Start Time and how frequent the train comes and watch the magic happen.

You will see in real time how long until the next train arrives and at what time the next train will arrive.
